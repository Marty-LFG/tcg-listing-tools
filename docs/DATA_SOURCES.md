# Data sources

Per-game APIs, the fields each builder maps, and how auth/limits work. All calls
go through the Vite dev-server proxies (see `vite.config.js`); the builders never
hit these hosts directly (CORS / key injection). Base URLs below are the *real*
upstream — the builder uses the proxy prefix (e.g. `/api/pkm`).

> When extending a builder, confirm field names against a live response — schemas
> drift. The notes below were accurate at build time.

## Pokémon — pokemontcg.io v2  (proxy `/api/pkm`)

- Upstream: `https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2`
- Card: `GET /cards/{id}` where `id = "{set.id}-{number}"` (e.g. `sv4-25`).
- Sets: `GET /sets?pageSize=500` → `{ data: [...] }`.
- Responses are wrapped in `{ data: ... }`.
- **Auth:** works **keyless** (lower limit). Optional `X-Api-Key`
  (`POKEMONTCG_API_KEY`) → 20,000 req/day. Now under the Scrydex umbrella, but
  this legacy v2 endpoint still serves anonymous traffic.
- Card fields used: `name`, `supertype`, `subtypes[]`, `hp`, `types[]`, `number`,
  `rarity`, `set{ id, name, series, printedTotal, total }`, `images{ small,
  large }`, `tcgplayer.prices` (USD), `cardmarket.prices` (EUR).
- Set fields used (picker): `id`, `name`, `series`, `releaseDate`, `ptcgoCode`
  (the **printed code** on cards, e.g. `PAR`), `images.symbol` (set symbol icon).
- Set picker resolves a typed token against `id`, `ptcgoCode`, **or** `name`
  (so `PAR`, `sv4`, and `Paradox Rift` all find Paradox Rift). Sets are cached in
  `localStorage` (`pkm_sets_v1`) and refreshed in the background.

## Magic: The Gathering — Scryfall  (proxy `/api/mtg`)

- Upstream: `https://api.scryfall.com`
- Card: `GET /cards/{set}/{collector_number}` (e.g. `/cards/blb/1`).
- Sets: `GET /sets` → `{ data: [...] }` (filter `digital`, sort by `released_at`).
- **Auth:** none. Scryfall asks for a `User-Agent` + `Accept` header — the proxy
  adds them. Returns the card object directly (not wrapped); errors are
  `{ object: "error", ... }`.
- Card fields used: `name`, `set`, `set_name`, `collector_number`, `rarity`,
  `colors[]`, `type_line`, `finishes[]` (nonfoil/foil/etched), `frame_effects[]`
  + `border_color` + `full_art` (→ treatment: Showcase / Extended Art /
  Borderless / Full Art), `prices{ usd, usd_foil, usd_etched, eur }`,
  `image_uris{ large, normal, png }`, `card_faces[]` (double-faced → back image).

## Star Wars: Unlimited — swu-db  (proxy `/api/swu`)

- Card: `GET /cards/{set}/{number}` with the number **3-digit zero-padded**
  (e.g. `sor/010`).
- 7 released sets at build time: `sor, shd, twi, jtl, lof, sec, law`.
- **Auth:** none. swu-db returns `200` without CORS headers, hence the proxy.
- Fields used: `Name`, `Subtitle`, `Type`, `Aspects[]`, `Arenas[]`, `Traits[]`,
  `Cost`, `Power`, `HP`, `Rarity`, `VariantType`, `MarketPrice`/`LowPrice` (USD),
  `FrontArt`, `BackArt` + `DoubleSided` (leaders/back art).

## Riftbound — Scrydex  (proxy `/api/rb`)

- Upstream: `https://api.scrydex.com/riftbound/v1`
- Card: `GET /cards/{EXP-NUM}` (e.g. `OGN-296`).
- Expansions: `GET /expansions`.
- **Auth required:** `X-Api-Key` + `X-Team-ID` (injected from `.env`). No key →
  no data.
- Card fields used: `id`, `name`, `number`, `printed_number`, `domain`, `type`,
  `rarity`, `rules`, `images[]{ small, medium, large }`, `expansion{ name, code }`,
  `variants[]{ name (normal|foil), prices[]{ condition (NM…), market, currency,
  trends{ days_1, days_7, days_30, days_90 { price_change, percent_change } } } }`.
- **Offline fallback:** the builder embeds card data for the first 3 sets
  (Origins/OGN, Proving Grounds, Spiritforged/SPF), so those work with no key.
  Live Scrydex covers all sets (incl. later ones) and supplies pricing + the
  trend graph.
- Name handling: a card's `name` may include the subtitle (`"Kai'Sa - Survivor"`);
  the alt-art print appends `"(Alternate Art)"`, which the builder strips for the
  clean field and re-derives as the `(Alt Art)` title tag.

## FX rates — Frankfurter  (proxy `/api/fx`)

- `GET /latest?from=USD&to=AUD,EUR,GBP,JPY` → `{ rates: { AUD, ... }, date }`.
- ECB data, no key. Cached in memory per session by `TCG.loadFx()`. Used to show
  `≈ A$` next to USD/EUR prices and to power the converter widget.

## Pricing notes / gotchas

- **TCGplayer API** is closed to new developers (since late 2024) — not an option
  for new price sources.
- The Pokémon `tcgplayer.prices` object has multiple buckets
  (normal/holofoil/reverseHolofoil); the extras panel takes the first available
  market price as a sanity check, not gospel — verify chase cards against live
  comps.
- **Finish/printing is not reliably in any of these APIs** (which physical
  variant you hold). Those dropdowns stay manual.
- Prices come back in **USD/EUR**; everything user-facing is converted to **AUD**
  via `/api/fx`.

## eBay AU buyer-protection fee (landing-page calculator)

Marginal tiers on the **list price `L`**, plus a flat `A$0.30`:

| Portion of L | Rate |
|---|---|
| first $20 | 8% |
| $20–$500 | 6% |
| $500–$5000 | 4% |
| above $5000 | 0% (fee flat beyond this) |

Buyer total `T = L + fee(L)`. Inverse (back-out) used by the calculator:

| Target T | List L |
|---|---|
| ≤ 21.90 | `(T − 0.30) / 1.08` |
| ≤ 530.70 | `(T − 0.70) / 1.06` |
| ≤ 5210.70 | `(T − 10.70) / 1.04` |
| above | `T − 210.70` |

Because the buyer total moves in ~1.06¢ steps per 1¢ of list price, **not every
round target is reachable** — the calculator rounds to cents, searches the
neighbouring cents, and reports `Exact` or `Closest` accordingly. Verified
example: target `A$25.00` → list `A$22.92` → buyer pays `A$25.00` (Exact);
`A$31.00` is unreachable (closest buyer total `A$30.99`). eBay adjusts these
bands occasionally; if a real listing's total drifts from the prediction, update
the bands here and in `index.html`.
